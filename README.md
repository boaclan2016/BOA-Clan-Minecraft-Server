# BOA-Clan-Minecraft-Server

BOA Clan will use GitHub to track all issues with our Minecraft server.

GitHub is traditionally used for programmers to share their open source software. We don't have any software, but the Issues tool within GitHub works just too well not to use it. We tried other solutions but nothing quite compared to this!

You can safely ignore the "Code" tab - and most other tabs - of this project and move straight to the "Issues" tab!
